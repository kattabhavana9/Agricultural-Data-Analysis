This project analyzes data from the Indian agricultural economy, focusing on Minimum Support Price (MSP) trends and their impact on farmers' income. Agriculture is crucial to India's economy, making it essential to understand the relationship between MSP and farmer income for effective policy-making and improving livelihoods.

Using Power BI, I conducted a thorough analysis of agricultural data, examining MSP trends across various crops, regions, and time periods. The data was meticulously cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and reliability. Advanced data visualization techniques were employed to present trends and patterns in an interactive format. Power BI's dynamic dashboards allow users to explore the data, filter results by crop type, region, and year, and gain insights that inform decision-making.

In addition to standard visualizations, I utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for complex calculations that enhance the analysis. This includes assessing how MSP fluctuations affect farmers' income and understanding the economic implications of policy changes. Custom visuals were created to emphasize key data points, such as the link between MSP and production costs, regional income disparities, and the long-term effects of MSP adjustments.

The project's primary goal is to provide insights that assist policymakers, researchers, and agricultural experts in making data-driven decisions to support farmers and enhance the agricultural sector. By presenting complex agricultural data clearly and interactively, this project aims to foster a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities within India's agricultural economy.
